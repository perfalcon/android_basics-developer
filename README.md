>This NanoDegree program was given to me by the AT&T aspire tech scholarship program from Udacity.
I completed this in only 2 weeks! It was thanks to my prior knowledge of developing and programming,
which also came from Udacity (Front End & Full Stack Nanodegrees).
Now, i've become a mobile developer for Android. These skills are precious to me.
